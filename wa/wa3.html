        <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
            <p>Jane Remover (born <time datetime= "2003-09-26">September 26, 2003</time>) is an American musician. 
                She released her debut studio album, Frailty, in 2021, which was followed by Census Designated 
                in 2023, and Revengeseekerz in 2025. She pioneered the "dariacore" microgenre on SoundCloud with 
                her album of the same name, released under the pseudonym Leroy. She has also released music under 
                the alias Venturing, and her first album under this alias, Ghostholding, is set to release in 2025.</p>

        <h3><a id="biography">Biography</a></h3>
                <p>Remover, along with her twin sister, were born in Newark, New Jersey, living there until she and 
                    her family moved to Clark around 2011. She attended The College of New Jersey for one 
                    semester before leaving to pursue music full-time. She formerly made music under the pseudonym 
                    Dltzk. She came out publicly as a trans woman in 2022 creating her new name Jane Remover as she 
                    left her deadname behind.[3]</p>
        
        <h3><a id="Career">Career</a></h3>
                <p>A far cry from <a href="https://jarah-marshall.github.io/wa/wa3.html">Jazz</a>[<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>], Remover's interest in music production stems back as far as 2011, inspired by dubstep producers 
                    like Skrillex, Kill the Noise, and Virtual Riot. She would later go on to produce different 
                    styles of EDM in the mid-2010s, citing Porter Robinson as her biggest influence. From 
                    electronic music, Remover's production became more trap-centric around 2018; she cited artists 
                    such as Trippie Redd, Earl Sweatshirt, and Tyler, the Creator as inspirations. Guest 
                    production then became a large part of Remover's early career, with her being a member of multiple 
                    SoundCloud collectives such as PlanetZero and Graveem1nd. Her production gradually became more 
                    digicore-oriented.</p>

                <p>In late 2019, Remover began self-producing and releasing her own works on SoundCloud. One of 
                    Remover's first solo releases, "What's My Age Again?", gained popularity after being shared 
                    on Twitter. Her second EP, Teen Week, was released on <time datetime="2021-02-26">February 26, 2021</time> under the pseudonym 
                    Dltzk (stylized as "dltzk"). The track "Homeswitcher", featuring Kmoe, reached 100,000 
                    streams on SoundCloud within the first two weeks of its release.</p>

                <p>After the release of several more non-album singles, Remover began teasing the release of her 
                    debut studio album, Frailty, and releasing singles for it in <time datetime="2021-06">June 2021.</time> After the release of 
                    the tracks "How to Lie", "Pretender", and "Search Party", Frailty was released via DeadAir 
                    Records on <time datetime="2021-11-12">November 12, 2021</time>. The album was acclaimed by various publications, such as 
                    Pitchfork, who placed the album at #47 on their list of the best albums of 2021.</p>

                <p>On <time datetime="2022-06-27">June 27, 2022</time>, Remover announced the retirement of the Dltzk pseudonym, and introduced the 
                    name Jane Remover. On the same date, she released the single "Royal Blue Walls". In Remover's 
                    statement, she said "the stage name Dltzk has never sat right with [her]" and that it "reminds 
                    [her] of a period of [her] life [she'd] like to move past". She also announced that the Teen 
                    Week EP would be abridged, as she had become uncomfortable with the project as it was originally 
                    released. This change went into effect on <time datetime="2022-10-10">October 10, 2022</time>, and four songs were removed from 
                    the EP. Remover's second single released under the name Jane Remover, "Contingency Song", was 
                    released on <time datetime="2022-11-16">November 16, 2022</time>. She was the opening act for Brakence's Hypochondriac tour from 
                    <time datetime="2022-11-26">November 26</time> to <time datetime="2022-12-20">December 20, 2022</time>.</p>

                <p>In March of 2023, Remover became an official resident of NTS Radio, where she performed monthly 
                    hour-long sets, entitled "Wait Watch This," on the station's second channel. She retired her 
                    residency in December of 2024.</p>

                <p>On <time datetime="2023-08-23">August 23, 2023</time>, Remover shared the single "Lips" from her second album, Census Designated, which 
                    was released on October 20 of that year. On <time datetime="2023-09-20">September 20</time>, the album's title track, "Census 
                    Designated", was released along with an accompanying music video directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadeca">Quadeca</a>. The album 
                    saw her move away from bitcrushing and sampling towards a "blend of shoegaze and bedroom pop", guitar 
                    rock anthems with slow buildup and deafening noisy climaxes. A Pitchfork review of Census Designated 
                    compared this iteration of her sound to music acts such as Ethel Cain, My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive 
                    and yeule.</p>

                <p>In February 2024, Remover began the Designated Dreams tour, co-headlining alongside her labelmate Quannnic. 
                    Playing 12 dates across the US, the tour promoted both artists' albums released the year before, being 
                    Census Designated and Stepdream, respectively.</p>

                <p>Through August and September 2024, Remover opened for American rapper JPEGMafia's Lay Down My Life tour. 
                    In December 2024, Remover announced the Turn Up or Die tour, her first as the sole headliner. The tour will 
                    feature Dazegxd, as well as special guests d0llywood1 and Lucy Bedroque, and is set to begin in April 2025. 
                    On January 1, 2025, Jane Remover announced her third studio album, Revengeseekerz, alongside the release of its 
                    lead single, "JRJRJR". The album will release sometime in 2025.</p>

            <h4>Leroy</h4>
                <p>Leroy was a side project of Jane Remover, under which she created sample-heavy EDM mashups. These releases 
                    sampled a wide range of sounds, including pop songs of the 2010s, viral videos, and even Remover's own music. 
                    She released a series of albums with the name "dariacore", the first of them on May 14, 2021. The cover art 
                    for each album released under the Leroy moniker were screenshots from the TV series Daria, which led to the 
                    term "dariacore" being used to describe the unique production style that Remover used for these releases. 
                    The genre was described by Raphael Helfand of The Fader as "an entire genre in and of itself, taking hyperpop's 
                    silliest tendencies to their logical conclusions". <strong>Three</strong> albums were released under the pseudonym "leroy" 
                    from December 2020 to May 2022, after which the moniker was officially retired in June 2022 with the release 
                    of a DJ mix titled "Leroy & Dltzk Memorial Service". The Dariacore series of albums have since inspired 
                    many artists to adopt a similar style of production, releasing short sample-based EDM tracks themed around 
                    popular media.</p>

                <p>On <time datetime="2023-07-21">July 21, 2023</time>, Remover released the fourth and final studio album under the Leroy pseudonym, Grave Robbing, 
                    which premiered on NTS Radio.</p>

            <h4>Venturing</h4>
                <p>Venturing is a <em>side project</em> of Jane Remover. It initially started as a fictional indie rock band created by 
                    Remover. She released several tracks under the Venturing alias onto SoundCloud throughout 2022 and 
                    2023, before releasing Arizona, her official debut EP as Venturing, onto streaming platforms on <time datetime="2023-05-19">May 19, 2023</time> 
                    . Remover officially announced the project's debut studio album, Ghostholding, on December 5, 
                    2024. It is scheduled to be released on <time datetime="2025-02-14">February 14, 2025</time>.</p>
